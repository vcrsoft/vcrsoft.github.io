Landing new service jobs often means dealing with **low-quality leads** or customers who are not ready to act — costing you time and fuel. Customers expect prompt answers and estimates, but assessing every request manually can be inefficient.

Our AI Lead Qualification Chatbot solves this problem.

### The Power of Automated Lead Qualification and Scheduling

The bot acts as a tireless, expert intake agent. When a potential customer describes their issue, the chatbot guides them through a structured, diagnostic conversation — collecting essential information **and assessing urgency**.

**This process delivers four key benefits:**

1.  **Accurate Data Collection:** The bot gathers precise details on the problem, the customer’s situation, and any prior troubleshooting steps.  
2.  **Polished Lead Reports:** You receive a professional, easy-to-read report with a summary and full chat log, including the customer’s contact info.  
3.  **Preliminary Estimates & Lead Qualification:** Based on the collected data, the bot can generate a ballpark estimate and identify serious, actionable leads — so every lead in your inbox is qualified and ready to act on.  
4.  **Scheduling/Intent Assessment:** The bot asks when the customer wants service — today, this week, or later — allowing you to prioritize leads by urgency and readiness to book.

### Business Advantages

For home service pros, this approach saves time and increases revenue:

* **Eliminate Wasted Trips:** Only visit customers with qualified, actionable jobs.  
* **Focus on Billable Work:** Technicians spend less time on low-value diagnostic calls.  
* **Prioritize Ready-to-Book Jobs:** Know which leads are urgent and schedule accordingly.  
* **Increase Conversion Rates:** Delivering instant insights, estimates, and urgency improves your chances of closing sales quickly.

The AI Lead Qualification Chatbot ensures your effort is spent on the right jobs — giving you faster, more efficient, and more profitable service.
