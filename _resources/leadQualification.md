Landing new service jobs often means dealing with **low-quality leads** or customers who are not ready to pay — costing you time and fuel. Customers expect prompt answers and estimates, but assessing every request manually can be inefficient.

Our AI Lead Qualification Chatbot solves this problem.

### The Power of Automated Lead Qualification

The bot acts as a tireless, expert intake agent. When a potential customer describes their issue, the chatbot guides them through a structured, diagnostic conversation.

**This process delivers three key benefits:**

1.  **Accurate Data Collection:** The bot gathers precise details on the problem, the customer’s situation, and any prior troubleshooting steps.
2.  **Polished Lead Reports:** You receive a professional, easy-to-read report with a summary and full chat log, including the customer’s contact info.
3.  **Preliminary Estimates & Lead Qualification:** Based on the collected data, the bot can generate a ballpark estimate and flag serious, actionable leads—so every lead in your inbox is qualified and ready to act on.

### Business Advantages

For home service pros, this approach saves time and increases revenue:

* **Eliminate Wasted Trips:** Only visit customers with qualified, actionable jobs.
* **Focus on Billable Work:** Technicians spend less time on low-value diagnostic calls.
* **Increase Conversion Rates:** Delivering instant insights and estimates improves your chances of closing sales quickly.

The AI Lead Qualification Chatbot ensures your effort is spent on the right jobs, giving you faster, more efficient, and more profitable service.
