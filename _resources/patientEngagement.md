As a medical provider, the patient portal is a key way for you to engage with your customer, the patient.

Patient engagement encompasses a variety of tasks, functions, and processes that pertain to providing service to a patient. A key requirement for any patient engagement software solution is a tight integration with the provider's electronic health record (EHR) system. Examples of popular EHR systems include Epic, AthenaHealth, eClinicalWorks, and Cerner. While many of these EHR systems also provide patient portals, third-party patient portal solutions, such as ours, provide enhanced features that could be customized better to suit your needs. 

Our patient engagement software solution, delivered via our own portal, has the AI chatbot as the primary interface for interacting with the patient. This provides a different patient experience when compared with more conventional website or mobile app interfaces that are menu / forms driven. Our AI-powered chatbots provide a natural way of engaging with the patient in a friendly manner. The conversational interface is the natural communication mode for all human beings ; patients are no exception. Chatbots are better able to pose the right questions to the patient based on their medical history and the context of the dialog. To the extent required by legal, provider or payor regulations, we can still integrate questionnaires and forms into the dialog interface. 

Here a few basic steps in the patient engagement workflow:

1. Patient registration: A patient that is new to your practice will fill out a form to obtain login credentials. Once approved, the patient will be able to use the portal.
2. Patient intake / appointments: A chatbot guides the patient through the process of booking an appointment. Using the patient's medical history as context, the chatbot interacts with the patient to obtain relevant information (such as symptoms) pertaining to their medical issue. This enables the chatbot to book an appointment, for the patient, with the appropriate healthcare provider.
3. Patient questions: A crucial part of patient engagement is the ability to address patient questions and concerns. A chatbot, uses the patient medical history as context to retrieve relevant information from the patient's records. It can also provide general educational content tailored to the patient's needs.
4. Messaging doctors: Patients can message their doctors securely through the portal. The chatbot helps the patient determine if a message is necessary based on whether the information can be deduced from the patient's records or other sources. The chatbot helps the patient compose the message to the doctor.

 

The key driver in intelligent engagement is context. Our chatbot technology retrieves relevant information from the patient's electronic health records (EHR), summarizes it, and provides it as context for the chatbot. This enables the chatbot to engage in intelligent dialog in a manner that is customized to each patient's unique situation. We provide a separate chatbot for each key function, such as booking appointments or accessing medical records, in order to keep the scope contained and the dialog focused and coherent. Our chatbots can perform business functions by accessing the appropriate IT system such as the EHR.
