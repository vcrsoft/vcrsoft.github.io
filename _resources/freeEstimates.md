The biggest obstacle to landing a new service job is the **diagnostic fee** or the **trip charge**. Customers expect a free estimate, but you can't offer one without spending time and fuel to assess the problem.

Our Remote Diagnostic Chatbot solves this paradox.

### The Power of Automated Pre-Qualification

The bot acts as a tireless, expert intake agent. When a potential customer describes their issue, the chatbot guides them through a step-by-step diagnostic process.

**This process achieves three critical goals:**

1.  **Gathers Accurate Data:** The bot collects precise details on symptoms, timelines, and basic troubleshooting steps the customer has already tried.
2.  **Generates an Estimate:** Based on the gathered data, the system can instantly generate a preliminary, AI-backed free estimate—meeting the customer's core expectation immediately.
3.  **Qualifies the Lead:** You receive a complete chat transcript, the customer’s contact information, and the preliminary estimate they received. This means every lead that hits your inbox is pre-qualified and ready for scheduling, not just an initial tire-kicker.

### The Financial Advantage

For a home service pro, this model immediately cuts costs:

* **Zero Wasted Trips:** Stop driving across town to deliver an estimate that the customer may balk at.
* **Time is Money:** Your technicians spend less time diagnosing basic issues and more time on billable repairs.
* **Higher Conversion:** By delivering instant value (the free estimate), you dramatically increase the likelihood of closing the sale before a competitor even answers the phone.

The Remote Diagnostic Chatbot ensures your effort is only spent on high-quality, high-certainty jobs.
