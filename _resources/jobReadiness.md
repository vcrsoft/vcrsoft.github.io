Landing new service jobs often means dealing with **unprepared leads** or customers who don’t provide enough information — costing you time, fuel, and first-time fix opportunities. Customers expect prompt answers, but manually assessing every request is inefficient.

Our AI Job Readiness Chatbot solves this problem.

### The Power of Automated Job Readiness Assessment

The bot acts as a tireless, expert front desk. When a potential customer describes their issue, the chatbot guides them through a structured diagnostic conversation — collecting essential information **and providing early clues about tools, parts, and urgency**.

**This process delivers four key benefits:**

1.  **Accurate Intake Data:** The bot gathers precise details on the problem, customer context, and any prior troubleshooting.  
2.  **Job Readiness Reports:** You receive a professional, easy-to-read report summarizing the issue, likely tools/parts needed, and full transcript of the conversation.  
3.  **Preliminary Estimates & Readiness Insight:** Based on collected information, the bot provides a wide-range cost estimate and flags the urgency/intent to schedule.  
4.  **Scheduling & Urgency Assessment:** Customers indicate when they want service — today, this week, or later — so you can prioritize jobs by readiness and first-time fix probability.

### Business Advantages

For home service pros, this approach saves time and increases efficiency:

* **Reduce Wasted Trips:** Technicians arrive prepared, lowering the risk of second visits.  
* **Optimize Technician Time:** Less time spent chasing unclear or unprepared leads.  
* **Prioritize Ready-to-Book Jobs:** Know which jobs are urgent and schedule effectively.  
* **Improve First-Fix Rates:** Early diagnostics and cost estimates help your team bring the right tools and parts for a successful first visit.

The AI Job Readiness Chatbot ensures your effort is focused on the right jobs — enabling faster, more efficient, and more profitable service.
