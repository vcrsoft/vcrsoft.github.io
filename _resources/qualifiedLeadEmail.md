| **User** | leaky bathtub faucet |
| **Model** | Thank you for reaching out about your leaky bathtub faucet. Can you tell me exactly where the leak is coming from? Is it dripping from the main spout, leaking around the handles, or elsewhere? |
| **User** | spout |
| **Model** | The leak is from the main spout. Could you tell me if your bathtub faucet has: 1. A single handle for hot and cold, or 2. Two separate handles? |
| **User** | single handle |
| **Model** | Understood. Is the leak constant, even when turned off, or only when in use? |
| **User** | constant drip |
| **Model** | Thanks. A constant drip from a single-handle bathtub spout usually indicates a problem with the internal cartridge. What is the brand of your faucet, if known? |
| **User** | moen |
| **Model** | A Moen single-handle faucet with a constant drip. Likely the cartridge needs replacement. |
