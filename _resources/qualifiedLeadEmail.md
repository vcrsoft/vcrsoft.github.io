    <td>Okay, the leak is coming from the main spout. This is a common issue. To help me diagnose further, could you tell me if your bathtub faucet has: 1. A single handle that controls both hot and cold water? 2. Two separate handles, one for hot and one for cold? </td>

  <tr>
    <td><strong>Model</strong></td>
    <td>Understood, a single-handle faucet leaking from the spout. Is the leak a constant drip, even when the faucet is completely turned off, or does it only leak when you're using the faucet?</td>

    <td><strong>User</strong></td>
    <td>constant drip</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Model</strong></td>
    <td>Thank you for clarifying. A constant drip from a single-handle bathtub spout, even when turned off, typically indicates an issue with the faucet's internal cartridge. To help confirm this and narrow down the specific cartridge type, could you tell me the brand of your bathtub faucet, if you know it? Sometimes the brand name is visible on the handle, escutcheon plate, or spout.</td>

<strong>Summary Diagnosis:</strong> Based on the information provided, it appears you have a single-handle Moen bathtub faucet with a constant drip from the spout even when turned off. This strongly suggests the internal Moen cartridge needs to be replaced. This is a common wear-and-tear item that controls the water flow and temperature.

<strong>Rough Estimate:</strong> The typical cost for replacing a Moen single-handle bathtub faucet cartridge, including parts and labor, generally ranges from $200 to $400. This estimate can vary slightly depending on the specific Moen cartridge model and ease of access.

Someone will contact you shortly to schedule an appointment for a visit to confirm the diagnosis and provide a precise quote.

Goodbye.</td>
