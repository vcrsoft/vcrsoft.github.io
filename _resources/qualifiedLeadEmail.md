## Diagnostic Summary

**Confirmed Issue:** Leaky Bathtub Faucet  

**Diagnosis Confidence:** High  

**Detailed Finding:**  
Based on the customer's responses, the issue is a **constant drip** coming from the main spout of a **single-handle Moen** bathtub faucet, even when fully turned off.

This strongly indicates a worn internal **Moen cartridge**â€”a common component that controls water flow and temperatureâ€”likely requiring replacement.

    <td>Okay, the leak is coming from the main spout. This is a common issue. To help me diagnose further, could you tell me if your bathtub faucet has: 1. A single handle that controls both hot and cold water? 2. Two separate handles, one for hot and one for cold?</td>

    <td><strong>Model</strong></td>
    <td>Understood, a single-handle faucet leaking from the spout. Is the leak a constant drip, even when the faucet is completely turned off, or does it only leak when you're using the faucet?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Model</strong></td>
    <td>Thank you for clarifying. A constant drip from a single-handle bathtub spout, even when turned off, typically indicates an issue with the faucet's internal cartridge. To help confirm this and narrow down the specific cartridge type, could you tell me the brand of your bathtub faucet, if you know it? Sometimes the brand name is visible on the handle, escutcheon plate, or spout.</td>
