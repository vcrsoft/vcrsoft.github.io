While our chatbots are patient-facing, they also assist doctors, nurses and other medical staff in performing their duties.

Here are a few examples:

1. Booking an appointment: Before scheduling the appointment, the chatbot gathers relevant information from the patient using their medical history as context. This ensures that only essential appointments are scheduled with the right medical provider, for example, the right specialist. This is better than filling out an exhaustive questionnaire or filling out lengthy forms. The chatbot summarizes the conversation into an appointment note, for this patient, that is stored in the provider's electronic health record (EHR).

2. Messaging the doctor: When the patient wants to message the doctor, the chatbot first gets background information on the patient's issue and question for the doctor. If the chatbot can resolve the issue based on the patient's medical record or other provider supplied documentation, it tries to satisfy the patient's question. This may obviate the need for the message thereby saving both parties time and money. If the chatbot determines that a message needs to be sent to the provider, it drafts a message to the provider, on behalf of the patient, with all the relevant context about the patient's medical history and background about the pertinent issue. It also suggests remedies that the doctor might consider while responding back to the patient. This will save the doctor / provider considerable time with regards to researching the patient / issue.

3. Accessing medical records and asking questions: The chatbot facilitates the patient's access to their medical records, helps them retrieve and interpret the right records, and answer their questions that might require some medical knowledge. This will save the doctor's office / clinic considerable time with respect to responding to potential patient queries that can otherwise be addressed through such a chatbot. Again, the conversational interface and the human-like nature of the interaction encourages the patient to utilize this "self-serve" option before reaching out to the provider through conventional communication channels such as phone, email or text.
